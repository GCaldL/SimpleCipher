CipherBasic v0.01 by GCaldL

A bare bones c++ implementation of a cesar cipher(lacking numerical, CAPS and special charater support).
â€¢supports basic alpabetical ciphers

side note: I just noticed a small bug that for negative shift intigers, border charaters are converted incorrectly ect. b -3 = a (when it should be y), will fix when I get a chance...
